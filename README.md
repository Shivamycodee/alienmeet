## *No borders. Just Peoples* 🌍✨  

AlienMeet is a platform where you can connect with random people without sharing any personal information. It’s designed to be fast, secure, and private, leveraging the power of **WebRTC** for a decentralized infrastructure.  

## Why AlienMeet? 🤔  
- 🔒 **Privacy First:** No personal information is required to connect.  
- 🌐 **Decentralized Technology:** Only a signaling server is used to establish connections, while video and audio sharing happens directly between peers.  
- ⚡ **Speed:** Faster than traditional apps due to the peer-to-peer nature of WebRTC.  

## How It Works 🛠️  
1. 🖥️ AlienMeet uses a signaling server to connect you with a random person.  
2. 🔗 Once connected, all communication (video, audio, etc.) happens directly between you and the other person using WebRTC.  
3. 🛡️ This ensures low latency and high privacy.
